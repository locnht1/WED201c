        <h1>Some common inline tags</h1>
        <h2>Citing a source cite</h2>
        <p>The &lt;cite&gt; element makes it much easier for people and bots to search the code for specific information. </p>
        <p>A great reference for these and other elements is <cite>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/</cite> </p>

        <hr>
        <h2>Defining your abbreviations - abbr</h2>
        <p>The &lt;abbr&gt; element will display an abbreviation on the browser. Usually it will use the title attribute which will generate an underline and also provide a full definition of the accronymn when someone hovers over the word. </p>
        <abbr title="Sun">Sunday</abbr>, <abbr title="Mon">Monday</abbr>, <abbr title="Tues">Tuesday</abbr>, etc. <br>
        <p>Screen readers will read out the text, but don't forget that not everyone uses a mouse to navigate a page!! So it is always a good idea to define your acronyms somewhere in the text as well.</p>
        
        <hr>
        <h2>Specifying the use of time - time</h2>
        <p>The &lt;time&gt; element is again a completely semantic tag - it does not change any of the styling but it can allow systems to know to associate it with a calendar.</p>
        <p>"The concert took place on <time datetime="2023-4-14T19:00">April 14</time>."</p>
        may look like regular text, but look at the code used to generate it: <br>
        <p>The concert took place on &lt;time datetime=&quot;2023-4-14T19:00&quot;&gt;April 14&lt;/time&gt;</p>

        <hr>
        <h2>Identifying code fragements - code</h2>
        <p>The &lt;code&gt; element is often displayed in a different font, but also some (just a little) semantic meaning. You can this tag or later you can use <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to style anything to look more like computer code.</p>

        <hr>
        <h2>Using subscripts(mũ dưới) and superscripts(mũ trên) - sub(dưới) and sub(trên)</h2>
        <p>The &lt;sub&gt; and &lt;sup&gt; element are used to create the super and subscripts, e.g, H<sub>2</sub>0 or 1<sup>st</sup>.<br>
         In the past people would often use images to display mathematical formulas, but those images weren't always accessible.</p>
